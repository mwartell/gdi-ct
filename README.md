a GirlDevelopIt course on computational thinking

These materials are provided for a [GirlDevelopIt][1] course to be presented
in Philidelpha in April 2016. The core content here resides in the OpenDocument
Presentation slide show with the data file and source code in support of that.

Since most of the substance of this course will be in the presentation itself, you 
may not be able to derive much from the assets, but you're welcome to try.
