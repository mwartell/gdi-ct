# gdi-ct
a GirlDevelopIt course on computational thinking using Python

The datafile [ice-cream.csv][1] is more convenient to download using "Save Asâ€¦" from your browser.
Students who have installed [Jupyter Notebook][2] (also known as IPython Notebook) may find it
useful to also download the [gdi-tlapip.ipynb][3] file to save a little typing during the course.

These materials are provided for a [GirlDevelopIt][4] course to be presented
in Philidelpha in April 2016. The core content here resides in the OpenDocument
Presentation slide show with the data file and source code in support of that presentation.

Since most of the substance of this course will be in the presentation itself, you 
may not be able to derive much from the slides and code, but you're welcome to try.
