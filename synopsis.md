# GirlDevelopIt â€“ Computational Thinking with Python

This course is a second course in Python that looks more intently at the
practice of programming than the program itself. We develop a short but
very typical application that obtains data, refines the information to
a more useable form, and outputs its results in a standard format.

Of greater interest than the code is the reasoning that leads to design
and tool choices. Particular focus is paid to errors in the input and
the code and the ways those can be addressed. We also approach the
data processing task, identify its limitations and strike off in a
more generalized path.

We expect the student to have had prior introduction to Python, its
general syntax, lists, functions, and dictionaries. With the longest
script being 31 lines long, this course is not code heavy. The student
is expected to leave with a better understanding of how to think about
programming.
